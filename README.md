# The Wordmaker
What, exactly, is The Wordmaker? And *why* is it?
## The Wordmaker is a project that came about because...
...Well, I thought it would be fun. And I like words, so creating new ones seemed like an interesting premise.

At 7:04 PM, I completed a more or less operational version of my program. However, there were still features I wanted to fine-tune, and things I was considering adding.

## Features
Make words of varying lengths! If you load the program up after saving multiple words, you can also make them battle to determine which word is best! (Unfortunately, the code does not support saving your list of fighters.)
